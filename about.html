      <h5 class="w3-center">Tradition since 2018</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Catering is defined as the business of providing food and drink, typically at social events and in a professional capacity either on-site or at a remote site. The term was originally coined by the Merchant Marines, who were among the first to employ catering officers for their vessels. These catering officers were responsible for purchasing goods, preparing food, and serving the meals and beverages to the other people on board the vessels. They also had to perform other ship-related tasks.

The catering industry is still very young.Almira Catering started booming after the war when companies who had previously made food supplies for World War II needed something to do. As people became wealthier and the economy grew, caterers found there was a demand for their services, which has previously been reserved for the very rich.

      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">The modern improvement of transportation, technical innovations, population increase, and sudden rise in the trade of travel and tourism has given gastronomy today an ever increasing rise in popularity and major factor in our current economy. Almira Catering is proud to be part of this rich and colored history of gastronomy for nearly 2 years.</p>
