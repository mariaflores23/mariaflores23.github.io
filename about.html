      <p class="w3-large">Maria started his career as an apprentice crafting his skill. Over the years, Maria has perfected his culinary artistry in both the private and business sectors. In 2004, Catering Experience was formed through a partnership with Jim Variglotti of The Cuyahoga Group, and Andy. Maria’s love for food and people have fueled his desires to make every catering event special. Andy will tell you, “ It’s no secret. Food can make or break an event. Menu, Taste, Presentation, Timing and Service all have to make sense, and it all has to be perfect.”
