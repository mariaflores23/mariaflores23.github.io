In 2018, Catering Experience was formed through a partnership with Jestoni Tuma-ob of The Cusine Group, and Andy. Maria’s love for food and people have fueled his desires to make every catering event special. Andy will tell you, “ It’s no secret. Food can make or break an event. Menu, Taste, Presentation, Timing and Service all have to make sense, and it all has to be perfect.”
